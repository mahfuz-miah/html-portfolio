<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello<br />
This is Mahfuz Miah. I am from Bangladesh currently living in Poland.
I am a graduate student of Poznan University of Life Sciences, Poznan,
and doing MSc in Food Technology and Human Nutrition. Before starting my MSc 
I had a 5 years of study gap. Basically I did nothing in those gap years. I
completed my bachelor degree in Food Technology and Nutritional Science from
one of the reknowed public universty in Bangladesh; Mawlana Bhashani Science
and Technology University, Tangail.</p>

<p>I had no plan to come to Europe, specially in Poland. But we never know
what almighty Allah hold in fate for us. Here the same thing happeded. My fate has
brought me here. I am struggling after coming here. Initially I was literally
overwelmed to see the extensive and rigorous Master's study syllabus. On top
of the long class lectures, I had to attend 4 hours lab class that was
unbelievable for me! I remembered that I had only 2/3 lab classes in whole semester
in one course when I was doing my BSc in Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology 
Unviersity and the every lab class was just 1 to 1.5 hours long. But here I have
to attend 4 hours classes and each day I have to do several lab tests that is
literally equal to the whole semester's bachelor one course lab in just
one day. Now I am in second semester and this semester has 2 lab classes that last
4 hours each. Now I am settled here and I know the education system. I have do this
if I want to succesfully complete my study.</p>

<p>Another thing that shocked me is that even though Poland is not a rich country,
it is an European country and in sengen listed country after all,So my expectation 
was that earning would be nice! But the reality is totally different than my
imagination. Getting a part-time job is so hard that I and one of my friend,
Soleman from Pakistan randomly looked for job for first 4/5 months. We searched 
every possible places either factories and restaurant jobs but was not
able to secure a job. Eventually my friend Soleman dropped out the MSc course
and left to Poznan city for capital city Warsaw, Poland. Now he is doing job and
leading a good life. But I am continuing my study with borrowing money from
maternal uncle. Even though I hate borrowing money but I am lucky at the same time
thinking that I am continuing study with this borrowed money. May allah bless me
and help me complete my study here. I am looking forward to the valediction day!</p>
