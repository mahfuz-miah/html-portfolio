<h3>মদিনা, তুই কি মনে করছস স্যার তোকে ভালবাসে, এজন্যই প্রাণ খুলে হাসছিস, স্যার কিন্তু আমারে খুব পসন্দ করে, But আমি তেমন পাত্তা দেইনা</h3>

<p>Sufian Islam Zahid, a friend of mine, is the kind of person
that cannot be explained in words. I met him for the first time
at Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, where both
of us completed our Bachelor's degrees. We lived in the same 
housing during our sophomore year that didn't last maybe more 
than 1 year. At that time I didn't understand Zahid as a person 
since we didn't share a room.</p>

<p>Now come to the main point for what I am trying to write this.
After completing my Bachelor when I was preparing for higher
study I had the opportunity to share a room with Zahid.
Initially, I realized he is a nice person as I didn't see any 
discrepancy before. But at that time I observed that there is no
transparency,open-mindedness or clear-cut gestures in his 
character. He didn't care about his commitment. I was so much 
frustrated with his behavior that sometimes I thought How could a
person be like that!!! But the reality is; Yes! He is.</p>

<p>Another thing that should be mentioned about Zahid is that he
usually think that he is a very clever. But in reality, he
is foolish in almost every aspect of life. He is very bad at
critical thinking, situation analysis, reading people's
minds. Because of these drawbacks in his character, he has failed
to produce massive success in his life so far.</p>

<p>Honestly, he is not a good person as a friend. But at the same
time, he is not an ugly person either. He has some good character
too. But his bad way of dealing easily supersedes his few good 
ways of behaving.</p>
