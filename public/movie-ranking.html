<h1>The Best Movies According to Mahfuz Miah</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Epic</h3>
<p>Epic is an enimated movie. I love this movie. It is a 2013 American 
computer-animated fantasy action-adventure film loosely based on
William Joyce's 1996 children's book The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs.
It was produced by Blue Sky Studios. The is fictional movie based on tiny
lives in the forest. The story is evolved around a scientist who really think
that there is something tiny creatures that can not be seen naked eyes
live in the forest. The scientist has passed his wholed life just trying to
discover his assumption. Eventually the assumption of the scientist becomes 
true at the very end of the movie.</p>

<h3>The Message</h3>
<p>This is my favourite Movie. I love this movie.This movie briefly
dipicted the life of our beloved prophet Mohammad (PBUH) from his Mecca life
to Madina hizrat and ended the movie finally winning the Mecca. Every muslim
should watch the movie as it will encourage every viewer to sketch and
realize the picture and think how hard it was to survive in those dark era.

<h3>Dirilis Ertugrul</h3>
<p>This is a turkey historical drama TV series. I love this TV servies.
The story of the seires is based on real story of the last Islami Khelapah
of Ottaman Empire of Turkey. The popularity of this Series is sky-rocketing.
This series have made a history in Guinnes book of world record. This seires
were watched by more than 3 billioins of People! can you imagine, more than
3 billiions?? Total population of the world rihgt now is around 7.5 billions.
So around the half of the people of the world have watched the drama. But
personally I think the real viewers are more than the actual count as so many
people watched the drama way after telecasted and some people didn't watched
it in live telecated or in paid platform like Amazon prime or Netflix either.
Let me give you just one example; The drama started in 2014 and ended in 2019.
But I watched the series in 2021. So people like me who watched the series
after 2019 was not counted.
